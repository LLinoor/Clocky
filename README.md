## IMPORTANT :

1. The basic dial is based on the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZFfrjF-k4&t (big thanks to him ! :))

2. I DON'T KNOW IF THE IMAGES (DIALS) ARE LICENSED!

## Extension :
I quickly created a site extension for Chrome/Firefox, here is how to install it : 

### Firefox : 
If you use Firefox you can install the extension directly from the store, here is the link : https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/clocky

### Chrome and others :
If you have a version of Chrome or other, you can try to install the extension with the files included in the repo (tried on Edge Beta (Chrome, 86.0.622.11) and on Chrome (official, 85.0.4183.102)) :

Go to the extension page of your browser (chrome://extensions, for most browsers running on Chromium), activate the developer mode. To install the extension download the repo (or clone it), and drag the "Extension" folder in your browser to the extensions page .

### Old versions :
All versions of the extension are available on the release page or on the official Firefox extension page (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/clocky/versions/).

## URL :

The site is hosted on Google Firebase : https://clock-y.firebaseapp.com/index.html
